The ATM class represents an automated teller machine (ATM) that allows users to perform basic banking transactions like checking their balance, withdrawing cash, and depositing money. Here's a simple breakdown of how it works:

1. Attributes: The ATM has several important attributes:
   userAuthenticated: A boolean that indicates whether the user has successfully logged in.
   currentAccountNumber: Stores the account number of the authenticated user.
   screen, keypad, cashDispenser, depositSlot, and bankDatabase: These are components that help the ATM function, such as displaying messages, receiving user input, dispensing cash, accepting deposits, and managing bank account information.

2. Constants: There are constants defined for different transaction types: checking balance, withdrawing cash, depositing money, and exiting the system.

3. Constructor: The constructor initializes the ATM's attributes, setting the user as not authenticated and creating instances of the necessary components.

4. **Main Loop (run method)**: The run` method contains a loop that keeps the ATM running. It first checks if the user is authenticated. If not, it prompts the user to log in. Once authenticated, it allows the user to perform transactions. After the user is done, it resets the authentication status and thanks the user before starting over.

5. User Authentication (authenticateUser  method): This method prompts the user to enter their account number and PIN. It checks these credentials against the bank database. If they are correct, the user is authenticated; otherwise, an error message is displayed.

6. Transaction Handling (performTransactions method): This method displays a menu of options (check balance, withdraw cash, deposit funds, or exit) and processes the user's selection. Depending on the choice, it creates the appropriate transaction and executes it.

7 .Menu Display (displayMainMenu method): This method shows the main menu options to the user and returns their choice.

8. Transaction Creation (createTransaction method): This method creates a transaction object based on the user's selection (balance inquiry, withdrawal, or deposit) and returns it for execution.

In summary, the ATM class simulates the basic operations of an ATM, allowing users to log in, perform transactions, and log out, all while interacting with various components that handle the display, input, and banking operations.
